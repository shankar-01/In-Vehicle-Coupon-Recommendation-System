    <h1>In Vehicle Coupon Recommendation Prediction</h1>
    <p>
        To successfully grows a business, understanding customer behavior is essential.
        In recent years machine learning researchers have worked on customer behavior analysis.
        Many big tycoon companies such as Amazon, Google, and Facebook invest time, effort, and money in machine learning
        only to understand the behavior of users so they can make business decisions.
        In this project we have worked on “In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation”, training a machine learning
        model that predicts customer behavior that it will accept a coupon of a nearby location(restaurant or 
        coffee house, or bar) based on user, contextual and coupon information.
